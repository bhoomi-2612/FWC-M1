\item Evaluate: $\displaystyle \int (3x + 5)\sqrt{5 + 4x - 2x^2}\, dx$

\item Solve the differential equation:  
\[ x \frac{dy}{dx} + y - x + xy \cot x = 0,\; x \neq 0. \]

\item Solve the differential equation:  
\[ (x^2 + 3xy + y^2)\, dx - x^2\, dy = 0 \]  
given that \(y = 0\) when \(x = 1\).

\item Find the angle between the vectors  
\(\vec{a} + \vec{b}\) and \(\vec{a} - \vec{b}\)  
if  
\(\vec{a} = 2\hat{i} - \hat{j} + 3\hat{k}\)  
and  
\(\vec{b} = 3\hat{i} + \hat{j} - 2\hat{k}\).  
Also find a vector perpendicular to both.

\item Show that the lines
\[
\frac{x-1}{3} = \frac{y-1}{-1} = \frac{z+1}{0}
\quad \text{and} \quad
\frac{x-4}{2} = \frac{y}{0} = \frac{z}{-3}
\]
intersect. Find their point of intersection.

\item A committee of 4 students is selected from a group of 7 boys and 4 girls.  
Find the probability that the committee contains exactly 2 girls,  
given that at least one girl must be in the committee.

\item Show that the relation \(R\) defined by  
\((a,b) R (c,d) \Rightarrow a+d = b+c\)  
on the set \(A \times A\), where \(A = \{1,2,3,\ldots,10\}\),  
is an equivalence relation.  
Hence write the equivalence class of (3,4).

\item Solve for \(x\):  
\[
\begin{vmatrix}
a+x & a-x & a \\
a-x & a+x & a-x \\
a & a-x & a+x
\end{vmatrix}
= 0
\]

\item Show that the height of the cylinder of greatest volume  
inscribed in a right circular cone of height \(h\)  
and semi-vertical angle \(\alpha\)  
is one-third of the height of the cone,  
and the greatest volume is  
\[
\frac{4}{27}\pi h^3 \tan^2 \alpha.
\]

\item Using integration, find the area of the triangle  
formed by the negative x-axis  
and the tangent and normal to the circle  
\(x^2 + y^2 = 9\) at the point \((-1, 2\sqrt{2})\).

\item Find the coordinates of the foot of the perpendicular  
and the perpendicular distance from the point  
\(P(4,3,2)\) to the plane  
\(x + 2y + 3z = 2\).  
Also find the image of \(P\) in the plane.

\item A, B, and C throw a pair of dice alternately  
until one of them gets a total of 9 and wins the game.  
Find the probability that A wins, if A starts first.

\item A company manufactures two types of cardigans:  
type A and type B.  
Type A costs Rs.360 to make and sells for Rs.100 profit.  
Type B costs Rs.120 to make and sells for Rs.50 profit.  
The company can produce at most 300 cardigans  
and spend at most Rs.72,000 a day.  
The number of B-type cardigans cannot exceed  
the number of A-type by more than 200.  
Formulate as a linear programming problem  
and find the maximum profit graphically.
